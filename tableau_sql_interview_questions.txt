# Tableau Developer Interview Questions and Answers

## Tableau Fundamentals

### 1. What is Tableau and what are its key components?
**Answer:** Tableau is a visual analytics platform that helps people see and understand data. Its key components include:
- **Tableau Desktop:** Primary authoring tool for creating visualizations
- **Tableau Server:** Platform for sharing and collaborating on visualizations
- **Tableau Online:** Cloud-based version of Tableau Server
- **Tableau Public:** Free platform for creating and sharing visualizations publicly
- **Tableau Prep:** Data preparation tool for cleaning and shaping data
- **Tableau Mobile:** Mobile application for viewing dashboards on the go

### 2. Explain the difference between live connection and extract in Tableau.
**Answer:** 
- **Live Connection:** Directly queries the data source each time a visualization is viewed or interacted with. This ensures up-to-date data but may be slower depending on the data source performance.
- **Extract:** Creates a local copy of the data in Tableau's proprietary format. Extracts are faster to query but need to be refreshed to get updated data. They're useful for improving performance, working offline, or when the original data source is slow.

### 3. What are the different file types used in Tableau?
**Answer:**
- **.twb:** Tableau Workbook file that contains visualizations but not the data
- **.twbx:** Packaged Tableau Workbook that includes both visualizations and extract data
- **.hyper/.tde:** Tableau Data Extract files (.hyper is the newer format)
- **.tdsx:** Packaged Tableau Data Source that includes connection information and extract
- **.tds:** Tableau Data Source file with connection information but no data

### 4. What is a data source in Tableau?
**Answer:** A data source in Tableau is a connection to your data that includes information about the data location, connection parameters, field definitions, calculated fields, groups, sets, and other metadata. It can connect to various types of data including relational databases, spreadsheets, cloud data, and more.

### 5. Explain the difference between dimensions and measures in Tableau.
**Answer:**
- **Dimensions:** Categorical fields that segment data (like dates, names, categories) and typically appear as row/column headers. They're usually discrete (blue).
- **Measures:** Numeric values that can be measured and aggregated (like sales, profit, quantity). They're usually continuous (green).

Dimensions determine the level of detail in the view, while measures are the values being analyzed.

## Data Preparation and Transformation

### 6. How do you handle null values in Tableau?
**Answer:** Tableau offers several ways to handle null values:
- Use the IFNULL(), ISNULL(), or ZN() functions in calculated fields
- Filter out null values using the "Exclude" option
- Create a calculated field to replace nulls with a default value
- Use special null handling in table calculations
- Adjust the mark type and tooltip to handle nulls appropriately
- In visualizations, you can show or hide null indicators

### 7. Explain calculated fields in Tableau and provide examples.
**Answer:** Calculated fields allow you to create new data based on existing fields using formulas. Examples include:

- **Basic calculation:** `[Sales] / [Quantity]` to calculate average price
- **String manipulation:** `LEFT([Customer Name], 1)` to get the first initial
- **Date calculation:** `DATEDIFF('day', [Order Date], [Ship Date])` to calculate shipping days
- **Logical calculation:** `IF [Profit] > 0 THEN 'Profitable' ELSE 'Loss' END` to categorize transactions
- **Level of Detail (LOD):** `{FIXED [Customer]: SUM([Sales])}` to get total sales per customer regardless of view

### 8. What are Table Calculations in Tableau?
**Answer:** Table calculations are computations that are applied to the values in the visualization after Tableau has retrieved the data from the data source. They operate on the values currently in the view and can perform calculations like running totals, percent of total, rank, moving averages, and year-over-year growth. They're dependent on the dimensions in the view and their addressing and partitioning settings.

### 9. Explain Level of Detail (LOD) expressions in Tableau.
**Answer:** LOD expressions allow you to compute values at a different level of detail than the view level. There are three types:
- **FIXED:** Computes a value at the specified dimension level regardless of the view (`{FIXED [Region]: SUM([Sales])}`)
- **INCLUDE:** Computes a value at a more detailed level than the view (`{INCLUDE [Product]: SUM([Sales])}`)
- **EXCLUDE:** Computes a value at a less detailed level than the view (`{EXCLUDE [Region]: SUM([Sales])}`)

LOD expressions are powerful for cohort analysis, market basket analysis, and complex aggregations.

### 10. How do you blend data in Tableau?
**Answer:** Data blending in Tableau allows you to combine data from multiple data sources based on common dimensions:
1. Connect to primary data source
2. Create a visualization
3. Connect to secondary data source
4. Add fields from secondary source to the visualization
5. Tableau automatically creates relationships based on common field names
6. You can edit relationships if field names differ
7. Blending works like a left join, with all primary data and matching secondary data

## Visualizations and Dashboard Design

### 11. What are the key principles of effective dashboard design?
**Answer:** Effective dashboard design principles include:
- **Purpose:** Clear objective and audience definition
- **Simplicity:** Focus on key metrics without clutter
- **Layout:** Logical flow with most important information prominent
- **Consistency:** Uniform colors, fonts, and formatting
- **Interactivity:** Thoughtful filters and actions for exploration
- **Performance:** Optimized for quick loading and response
- **Context:** Providing reference points for interpretation
- **Accessibility:** Designing for all users including color-blind
- **Mobile-friendliness:** Responsive design for various devices

### 12. How do you create parameters in Tableau and what are they used for?
**Answer:** Parameters are dynamic values that can replace constant values in calculations, filters, or reference lines:
1. Right-click in the Data pane and select "Create Parameter"
2. Define data type, allowable values, and display format
3. Create a calculated field or filter that uses the parameter
4. Show the parameter control for user interaction

Parameters are used for:
- Creating what-if scenarios
- Dynamic filtering
- Reference line adjustments
- Switching measures in visualizations
- Controlling level of detail
- Dynamic date ranges

### 13. Explain actions in Tableau dashboards.
**Answer:** Actions in Tableau allow interactivity between visualizations:
- **Filter Actions:** Clicking in one view filters data in other views
- **Highlight Actions:** Clicking in one view highlights related data in other views
- **URL Actions:** Clicking opens a web page with dynamic parameters
- **Set Actions:** Clicking modifies set membership
- **Parameter Actions:** Clicking changes parameter values

Actions can be triggered by hover, select, or menu, and can be configured to keep or clear the action when deselected.

### 14. What are the different types of filters in Tableau and how do they work?
**Answer:** Tableau has several filter types:
- **Extract Filters:** Applied when creating extracts to limit data
- **Data Source Filters:** Applied to the entire data source
- **Context Filters:** Create a subset of data for other filters to work with
- **Dimension Filters:** Filter categorical values
- **Measure Filters:** Filter numeric values
- **Date Filters:** Specialized filters for date ranges
- **Quick Filters:** Interactive filters displayed on worksheets/dashboards
- **Global Filters:** Applied across multiple worksheets via dashboard actions

The order of operations is: Extract → Data Source → Context → Dimension → Measure → Table Calculation filters.

### 15. How do you optimize dashboard performance in Tableau?
**Answer:**
- Use extracts instead of live connections when possible
- Limit the number of marks (data points) in visualizations
- Use context filters to reduce the dataset
- Minimize the number of worksheets per dashboard
- Avoid complex calculations, especially nested calculations
- Use efficient joins and relationships
- Hide unused fields in the data source
- Use dashboard actions instead of quick filters when possible
- Aggregate data to appropriate level of detail
- Use the Performance Recorder to identify bottlenecks

## SQL for Tableau

### 16. How do you write a basic SQL query to retrieve data?
**Answer:** A basic SQL query follows this structure:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, SUM(column3) AS total
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column1, column2
HAVING aggregate_condition
ORDER BY column1 DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

For example, to get total sales by region and category:
```sql
SELECT region, category, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM sales_data
WHERE date >= '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY region, category
HAVING SUM(sales) > 1000
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```

### 17. Explain the different types of JOINs in SQL.
**Answer:**
- **INNER JOIN:** Returns only matching rows from both tables
- **LEFT JOIN:** Returns all rows from left table and matching rows from right table
- **RIGHT JOIN:** Returns all rows from right table and matching rows from left table
- **FULL OUTER JOIN:** Returns all rows from both tables
- **CROSS JOIN:** Returns Cartesian product of both tables (all possible combinations)

Example:
```sql
SELECT c.customer_name, o.order_date, o.amount
FROM customers c
INNER JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
```

### 18. How do you write a subquery in SQL?
**Answer:** A subquery is a query nested inside another query:

```sql
SELECT product_name, price
FROM products
WHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) FROM products);
```

Subqueries can be used in:
- SELECT clause (scalar subquery)
- FROM clause (derived table)
- WHERE clause (for filtering)
- HAVING clause (for filtering aggregates)

### 19. Explain window functions in SQL with an example.
**Answer:** Window functions perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row:

```sql
SELECT 
    order_date,
    sales,
    SUM(sales) OVER (ORDER BY order_date ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rolling_3day_sales,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY sales DESC) AS sales_rank
FROM sales_data;
```

Common window functions include:
- Aggregate functions: SUM(), AVG(), COUNT()
- Ranking functions: RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), ROW_NUMBER()
- Analytical functions: LEAD(), LAG(), FIRST_VALUE(), LAST_VALUE()

### 20. How do you write a SQL query for financial data analysis?
**Answer:** For financial data analysis, you might use:

```sql
-- Monthly revenue with year-over-year comparison
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM transaction_date) AS year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM transaction_date) AS month,
    SUM(amount) AS monthly_revenue,
    LAG(SUM(amount), 12) OVER (ORDER BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM transaction_date), 
                                       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM transaction_date)) AS revenue_previous_year,
    (SUM(amount) - LAG(SUM(amount), 12) OVER (ORDER BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM transaction_date), 
                                                      EXTRACT(MONTH FROM transaction_date))) / 
    LAG(SUM(amount), 12) OVER (ORDER BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM transaction_date), 
                                       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM transaction_date)) * 100 AS yoy_growth
FROM financial_transactions
WHERE transaction_type = 'revenue'
GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM transaction_date), EXTRACT(MONTH FROM transaction_date)
ORDER BY year, month;
```
