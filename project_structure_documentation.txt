# Project Structure Documentation for Tableau Development

This document outlines the standard project structure, methodologies, and processes used in professional Tableau development environments, particularly in the finance and insurance sectors.

## Agile/Scrum Methodology for Tableau Projects

### Sprint Structure

Tableau development projects typically follow a 2-4 week sprint cycle with the following components:

1. **Sprint Planning**
   - Review and prioritize backlog items
   - Estimate effort using story points
   - Commit to sprint deliverables
   - Define acceptance criteria for each user story

2. **Daily Stand-ups**
   - 15-minute daily meetings
   - Each team member shares:
     - What they accomplished yesterday
     - What they plan to work on today
     - Any blockers or challenges

3. **Sprint Review/Demo**
   - Demonstrate completed dashboards to stakeholders
   - Gather feedback for improvements
   - Validate that acceptance criteria are met
   - Document any new requirements for the backlog

4. **Sprint Retrospective**
   - Discuss what went well
   - Identify areas for improvement
   - Agree on action items for the next sprint
   - Celebrate successes

### User Stories for Tableau Development

Tableau user stories typically follow this format:

> As a [user role], I want [feature/dashboard] so that [business benefit].

Examples:
- "As a financial analyst, I want to see YTD performance compared to budget so that I can identify areas requiring attention."
- "As a risk manager, I want to visualize exposure by region and product so that I can identify concentration risks."
- "As a compliance officer, I want automated alerts for threshold breaches so that I can take timely corrective action."

Each user story should include:
- Acceptance criteria
- Mockups or wireframes
- Data requirements
- Performance expectations
