## Tips for Practice

1. **Start with simple visualizations** and gradually add complexity
2. **Document your approach** as you would explain it in an interview
3. **Create a portfolio piece** from one of these exercises to showcase during interviews
4. **Practice explaining your design decisions** out loud
5. **Time yourself** to simulate interview conditions
6. **Get feedback** from peers or online communities if possible
7. **Iterate on your solutions** to improve them
8. **Focus on business insights**, not just technical implementation
9. **Practice both prepared and ad-hoc analysis** scenarios
10. **Review and critique** existing dashboards to develop your analytical eye

## Resources for Creating Practice Data

If you don't have access to financial or insurance datasets, you can:

1. Use Tableau's built-in sample data (Superstore) and modify it
2. Generate synthetic data using Excel or Python
3. Find finance/insurance datasets on Kaggle or data.gov
4. Use Tableau Public to find financial dashboards and reverse-engineer them
5. Create mock data based on annual reports of public companies

Remember to focus your practice on finance and insurance scenarios to prepare specifically for your target role.
